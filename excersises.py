# 24. Use `a = ["Jake", "John", "Eric"]` and `b = ["John", "Jill"]`  lists to print out a set containing all the participants from event A which did not attend event B. Play around with those.


# 25. Create two functions that define a mutable iterable (as none and empty, respectively) as a first parameter and the value as another one. It adds a value to an iterable. Call & print it 3 times. Iterable defined as empty should add to iterable each time fct is called, while none should create a new list each time.
